# Vibe Coding Example

This is an example of a super basic adventure game written in Python. This generates a five-room text adventure that uses the terminal to enter commands.

adventure_final.py is the full working game.

Other .py files in this folder are iterations of different versions generated in the process of creating the game. All of these files were created by Chat GPT with only prompt input from me as an example of an experiment in "vibe coding."

## Testing

To run the game, just get into the folder and type
```python adventure_final.py```
or possibly
```python3 adventure_final.py```
on your terminal if you're on a Mac.

## Expanding this game

This little game is really basic, but feel free to use it as a starting point for your own vibe coding adventures.
